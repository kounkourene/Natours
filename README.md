Description of the project: Natours us a web application that allows users to see tours, book tours, create an account, login and search for tours. 
We created a RESTFUL API using Express. Using the data stored in the VS Code, we were able to create GET, POST, PATCH and DELETES routes. 
We are able to get a single tour, get all the tours, post a new tour, update and delete a tour. 
We also included a user route (get a single user, get all the users, create a new user, update a user and delete a user) but this route is not yet define. When trying to user any user route, we get the following: 
"status": error , "message": "this route is not yet define"
