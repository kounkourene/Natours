Description of the project: Natours us a web application that allows users to see tours, book tours, create an account, login and search for tours. 
We created a RESTFUL API using Express. Using the data stored in the VS Code, we were able to create GET, POST, PATCH and DELETES routes. 
We are able to get a single tour, get all the tours, post a new tour, update and delete a tour.
